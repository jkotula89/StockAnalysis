# StockAnalysis
This repository contains a set of notebooks, that analyze stock exchange prices and may help to identify valuable investments.

Questions I would like to answer are:

* Which index performs good (38, 100, 200, 365, 365*x days and so on)
* Which world region performs good? Which markets are emerging?
* Which components in Dax/MDax/SDax/TecDax/DivDax/GEX/FAZ perform well (before/after Corona crisis)?
* Which industry performs well and is expected to perform well in the future?
* What is the typical depth of a crash and width in indices (symmetry, shape)? 
  Idea: Smooth data & add rolling time window, make KDE estimates or take difference and search for a sign change in data
* What is the daily/weekly/monthly spread of an index?
* Add event data: categorize events
* Correlate events, dividends, seasonalities
* Add google trends keywords in analysis
* Are the price targets reasonable indicators for future stock prices?
* Add news feed to the pipeline (sentiment analysis)
* Can we spot trend changes or enhancements (because of events)?
